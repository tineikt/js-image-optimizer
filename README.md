# js-image-optimizer
NodeJS server that optimizes images based on URL and Accept header

If you want to run this locally you can use the included binary tools on Windows, all you need to install externally is "svgo" through npm `npm install -g svgo`.

On linux you will have to download and compile jpeg-archive, pngquant, cwebp and install svgo.
